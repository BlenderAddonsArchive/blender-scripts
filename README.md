## rotate_opengl_lights.py
Adds a simple modal operator for quick rotation access of OpenGL solid lights in the 3D viewport. Default hotkey is SHIFT + RMB (Substance Painter style), and rotates only one light. Rotation sensitivity and number of lights to rotate is exposed in the hotkey entry: 3D View > 3D View (Global) > Rotate OpenGL Lights.
